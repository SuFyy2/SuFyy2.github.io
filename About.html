        Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western-themed action-adventure video game 
        developed and published by Rockstar Games.It is the third entry in the Red 
        Dead series and a prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption and was released on 
        October 26th, 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and on November 5th, 2019 for PC.<br><br>

       Set in a fictional recreation of the American Old West in 1899, Red Dead 
        Redemption 2 focuses on the life of <a href="DONTFORGET!">Arthur Morgan</a> and his position in the 
        notorious <a href="DONTFORGET!">Van der Linde gang</a>. The game follows the gang's decline as they 
        are pursued by lawmen, fellow gangs and Pinkerton agents. The narrative 
        revolves around the characters of <a href="DONTFORGET!">Dutch van der Linde</a>, <a href="DONTFORGET!">John Marston</a> and <a href="DONTFORGET!">Micah</a>
        Bell in addition to Morgan.<br><br>

        Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in an open world consisting of five American regions,
        which the player can explore as they proceed with the story, and can be played through 
        both third-person and first-person view. As Arthur Morgan, players can interact with the
        game world in several ways, including story missions, side quests, challenges, randomized 
        events, and hunting. An Honor system, returning from the previous game, changes accordingly 
        to the player's actions towards non-player characters.<br><br>

        Upon release, Red Dead Redemption 2 received widespread universal acclaim; it was 
        praised for its writing, themes, characterization, open-world design, visuals, 
        realistic elements and attention to detail, though it also received criticism for 
        its control scheme and the effect of realism 
        on the gameplay.</p></div>

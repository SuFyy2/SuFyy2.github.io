        <h2>Hunting</h2>
        <p>Hunting in Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most important activities not strictly related to story progression. Through hunting, players can obtain meat, pelts and crafting items. Additionally, animal carcasses can be donated to Pearson in the Van der Linde gang camp, to help maintain it, or can be sold at butchers for a decent profit.
            <br><br>All wildlife in Red Dead Redemption 2 can be killed, but not all animals are created equal. The game employs a three-star rating system to let players evaluate the value of the animal's pelt on the fly. One star animals are not worth much, while three-star animals are the ones you want to kill, as they can net you a Perfect Pelt.
            <br><br>Animals in Red Dead Redemption 2 come in very different sizes, and, as such, there are specific weapons that have to be used against certain animals to get a Perfect Pelt. As a general rule, Sniper Rifles are the best for medium, large and massive animals. For very small animals, the Bow is the way to go. For moderately sized animals, the Varmint Rifle is the weapon of choice.</p>

        <h2>Wildlife</h2>
        <p>The diverse habitats and climates of Red Dead Redemption 2 are home to around 200 species of animals, birds and fish, all of which behave and respond to their environment in a unique way.

            Deer, bison and pronghorn traverse the plains in large herds, scavengers quickly sniff out carrion, sockeye salmon leap upstream, wolves attack in packs surrounding their prey, geese fly in fixed formations, possums play dead, rodents scamper into tree hollows, grizzly bears bluff charge when threatened, and birds of prey soar on thermals. They all form part of a complex ecosystem and must continually fight for their place on the food chain. The wilderness is at once a bountiful and perilous place, for both man and beast, and any predator can quickly turn prey.</p>

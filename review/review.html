        <p>As Red Dead Redemption 2 has begun making its way into the hands of eager players around the world, here’s a selection of review impressions from press outlets.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review-western-playstation-xbox-rockstar">The Guardian</a></h4>
        <p>"This is a story – a collection of stories, really – about the decline of a way of life, as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun the inexorable advance of American modernity, as well as the enemies and lawmen they have antagonised along the way...There can be no doubt that this is a landmark game. It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video game worlds..."</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review">IGN</a></h4>
        <p>"It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry."</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-seismic-achievement/">The Telegraph</a></h4>
        <p>"Rockstar is the master of open-world building, of course, with nothing coming close to Grand Theft Auto V’s urban sprawl until now. Red Dead Redemption 2 feels more of an artistic challenge. You will not find a better facsimile of Los Angeles than GTAV’s Los Santos, but in a sense that world is already defined by artifice. Creating something as natural as Red Dead Redemption 2 is a seismic achievement..." </p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/red-dead-redemption-2-review-gaming-pushed-limits-1154586">The Hollywood Reporter</a></h4>
        <p>"Every nuance of the game, from plot to game design, elevates the entire medium of gaming to levels that have until this point only been made in empty pre-launch promises. What Rockstar has delivered in Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just the best game of the year, but the best game of the decade. It does not set a new bar, but rather signals a changing of the guard, a new future for video games, as everything that comes after will be launching in a post-Red Dead Redemption 2 world." </p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review/">CNET</a></h4>
        <p>"Red Dead Redemption 2 has undoubtedly raised the bar for narrative open-world games and will likely have a lasting impact on how they are made in the future. It pushes the envelope of what we understand is possible in a video game. It seems that every time we get something new from Rockstar, things inevitably change."</p>
